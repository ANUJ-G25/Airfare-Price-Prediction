# Airfare-Price-Prediction
In this project, I developed an Airfare Price Prediction system using machine learning techniques to forecast flight ticket prices based on historical data. The dataset included over 300,000 observations with features like airline, flight, and departure time. I conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and trends. Data preprocessing involved cleaning the data, handling categorical variables with LabelEncoder, and standardizing features using StandardScaler. I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and selected the most relevant features. Multiple regression models were developed and evaluated, with XGBoost outperforming others in accuracy and error metrics. This project demonstrated my ability to apply advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems in the travel industry. Ultimately, the project provided valuable insights into airfare pricing, benefiting both consumers and service providers.
